Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)
A fully managed container orchestration service for running Docker containers.

AWS-managed: No need to install or operate your own control plane.

Supports EC2 launch type (containers run on your EC2 instances) or Fargate launch type (serverless containers without managing servers).

Best if you want deep AWS integration and a simpler, AWS-only environment.

Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
A fully managed Kubernetes control plane on AWS.

Lets you run standard Kubernetes clusters, so you can use the same Kubernetes tools you‚Äôd use on-prem or other clouds.

You still manage worker nodes (EC2 or Fargate) but AWS manages the Kubernetes master/control plane.

Best if you need multi-cloud portability, Kubernetes ecosystem tools, or already use Kubernetes.
Feature	ECS	EKS
Platform	AWS-native container service	Standard open-source Kubernetes
Complexity	Easier to set up and manage	More complex; follows Kubernetes concepts
Portability	Tied to AWS	Portable across clouds/on-prem via Kubernetes
Ecosystem/Tools	AWS ecosystem	Full Kubernetes ecosystem (Helm, operators)
Use Case	All-in-AWS workloads, simpler ops	Hybrid or multi-cloud, Kubernetes workloads

What are Security Groups in AWS?

A Security Group (SG) is basically a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances, RDS databases, and other resources in AWS.

It controls inbound and outbound traffic at the instance/network level.

Think of it as a list of rules that says:

‚ÄúWhich IP addresses or servers are allowed to talk to this resource?‚Äù (inbound)

‚ÄúWhich IP addresses or servers can this resource talk to?‚Äù (outbound)

üîπ Key Features

Stateful

If inbound traffic is allowed, the response is automatically allowed back, even if no outbound rule exists.

Attached to instances/resources

You attach SGs to EC2, RDS, Lambda (VPC), etc.

Works with IPs or other SGs

You can allow traffic from a specific IP range (e.g., 203.0.113.0/24) or from another security group (recommended for EC2 ‚Üî RDS).
\
Port-specific rules

Inbound and outbound rules can specify protocols and ports, e.g., TCP port 22 for SSH, port 3306 for MySQL.

üîπ Example

Suppose you have an RDS MySQL instance:

Rule Type	Protocol	Port Range	Source
Inbound	TCP	3306	sg-xxxx (EC2 SG)

This means only EC2 instances using that SG can connect to the RDS database on port 3306.

üîπ Summary

Security groups = AWS firewall rules.

Control who can connect to your resources.

Highly recommended: don‚Äôt open RDS to the world (0.0.0.0/0); always use EC2 SG or private IP range.
======================================================================
If EC2 and RDS are in the same VPC but in different subnets, here‚Äôs what you need to know:

üîπ Key Points

Same VPC = same network

EC2 can reach RDS as long as security groups allow it, even if they‚Äôre in different subnets.

Subnet type matters

Private subnet: No direct internet access, but EC2 can reach RDS in another private subnet.

Public subnet: Has internet access; can also reach RDS in private/public subnet.

Both subnets just need routing to each other via VPC‚Äôs main route table (default route exists in same VPC).

Security groups are crucial

RDS security group must allow inbound port 3306 from EC2 security group or EC2 subnet CIDR.

EC2 security group doesn‚Äôt need special outbound rules (default allows all outbound).

üîπ Steps to Connect in Different Subnets (Same VPC)

Check RDS SG

Inbound rule:

Type: MySQL/Aurora

Port: 3306

Source: EC2 security group (or EC2 subnet CIDR)

Check EC2 SG

Outbound: Allow all (default is usually fine)

Connect

From EC2 terminal:

mysql -h <RDS-endpoint> -u <username> -p


Enter your RDS password ‚Üí should connect.

‚úÖ Notes

Subnet doesn‚Äôt block traffic within the same VPC unless there‚Äôs a NACL (Network ACL) blocking it.

Private/public subnet difference only matters for internet access, not VPC-internal communication.
By default, resources in one VPC cannot talk to another VPC.
So if your EC2 is in VPC-A and your RDS is in VPC-B, the EC2 won‚Äôt be able to connect unless you explicitly allow it.
======================================================================================================================

‚úÖ Options to Connect EC2 ‚Üî RDS Across VPCs
1. VPC Peering (Most Common)

Create a VPC Peering connection between VPC-A (EC2) and VPC-B (RDS).

Update route tables in both VPCs so traffic can flow between them.

Update RDS security group to allow inbound MySQL (3306) traffic from the EC2‚Äôs private IP/subnet/security group.

EC2 can now connect to RDS via the RDS private endpoint.

2. AWS Transit Gateway (For multiple VPCs)

If you have many VPCs, use Transit Gateway instead of peering.

Attach both VPCs to the TGW.

Update route tables accordingly.

3. Make RDS Publicly Accessible (Not recommended for production)

In RDS settings, enable Public access = YES.

Assign RDS a public IP/endpoint.

Open the RDS SG to allow traffic from EC2‚Äôs public IP.
‚ö†Ô∏è Security risk ‚Üí not advised unless just testing.

4. VPN / Direct Connect (Cross-region / On-premises)

If your EC2 is in another region/VPC that can‚Äôt peer, you can connect using:

Site-to-Site VPN

AWS Direct Connect

üîπ What Happens in Different VPC?

Without peering/TGW/VPN, EC2 can‚Äôt reach RDS endpoint (connection timeout).

Even if you open all ports, traffic won‚Äôt flow because VPCs are isolated networks.

Types of EC2 instances what are security groups how can you backup files in EC2 instnaces
Types of EC2 Instances

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides different instance families for different workloads:

Instance Family	Use Case	Examples
General Purpose	Balanced CPU, memory, and networking for most workloads	t4g, t3, m6i, m5
Compute Optimized	High CPU performance for compute-intensive tasks like batch processing, gaming servers	c6g, c5
Memory Optimized	Large memory for in-memory databases, analytics, caching	r6g, x2idn, u-12tb1
Storage Optimized	High, fast local storage for big data, data wareh
ousing	i4i, d3, h1
Accelerated Computing (GPU)	Machine learning, graphics rendering, scientific simulations	p4d, g5, f1 (FPGA)

üí° Tip: Choose based on your workload. Example: t3.micro is free-tier eligible for light workloads.

‚úÖ 2. Security Groups

A Security Group (SG) acts like a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances.
It controls inbound (incoming) and outbound (outgoing) traffic.

Key Features:

Stateful: If you allow inbound traffic on a port, the response outbound is automatically allowed.

Rules are instance-level (not subnet-level like NACLs).

You can allow traffic by protocol, port, and source (e.g., IP or another security group).

Example Rules:
Direction	Protocol	Port	Source/Destination
Inbound	TCP	22	Your IP (for SSH)
Inbound	TCP	80	0.0.0.0/0 (for HTTP)
Outbound	All	All	0.0.0.0/0 (default allow)

üí° Always restrict SSH (22) to your own IP, not 0.0.0.0/0 for security.

‚úÖ 3. Backing Up Files in EC2 Instances

There are multiple ways to back up EC2 files depending on your needs:

üü¢ A. Create an AMI (Amazon Machine Image)

Creates a full snapshot of the instance (OS, data, configuration).

Go to EC2 Console ‚Üí Instances ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Create Image (AMI).

Useful for disaster recovery or cloning instances.

üü¢ B. EBS Snapshots

If your data is on an EBS volume, you can take incremental snapshots.

Go to Volumes ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Create Snapshot.

Snapshots are stored in Amazon S3.

üü¢ C. Manual File Backup

Use scp or rsync to copy files to:

S3 Bucket:

aws s3 cp /path/to/file s3://my-backup-bucket/


Local machine:

scp -i my-key.pem ec2-user@<EC2-Public-IP>:/path/to/file .

üü¢ D. AWS Backup Service

Automated centralized backup across services (EC2, EBS, RDS, etc.).

You can schedule daily/weekly backups.

üöÄ Best Practice Recommendation

For quick recovery of entire servers ‚Üí AMI + EBS Snapshots.

For critical data files ‚Üí S3 backup with lifecycle rules (e.g., Glacier for long-term).

Enable versioning in S3 for extra safety.
