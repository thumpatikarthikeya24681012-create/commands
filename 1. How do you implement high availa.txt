1. How do you implement high availability in AWS for a web application?
ðŸ‘‰ Deploy applications across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) using Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), Auto Scaling Groups (ASG), and Amazon RDS Multi-AZ for databases. This ensures minimal downtime and fault tolerance.


ðŸ‘‰ Disaster Recovery (DR) strategies in AWS:

Backup & Restore â€“ Store backups in S3/Glacier and restore during failure.

Pilot Light â€“ Minimal resources always running, scale up when needed.

Warm Standby â€“ A scaled-down version of the full system running continuously.
 
Multi-Site (Active-Active) â€“ Applications running in multiple regions for zero downtime.

3. How do you design a fault-tolerant architecture in AWS?
ðŸ‘‰ Use multi-AZ deployments, Auto Scaling, Load Balancers, RDS Multi-AZ/Read Replicas, and S3 cross-region replication. Fault-tolerant design ensures the system continues operating even if some components fail.

4. Explain zero-downtime deployment strategies in AWS.
ðŸ‘‰ Use Blue-Green Deployment or Rolling Deployment with Elastic Beanstalk, CodeDeploy, or ECS. This ensures new versions are deployed without impacting current users.

5. How do you implement security best practices in AWS (encryption, IAM roles, MFA)?
ðŸ‘‰ Best practices include:

Use IAM roles & policies with least privilege access.

Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).

Encrypt data at rest (KMS, S3 SSE) and in transit (TLS/SSL).

Use VPC security groups, NACLs, WAF, and GuardDuty.

6. What is the difference between CI/CD and why is it important?
ðŸ‘‰

CI (Continuous Integration): Frequent code integration, automated builds & testing.

CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery): Automated release to production.

Importance: Faster releases, fewer bugs, consistent delivery.

7. Which AWS services are used for CI/CD pipelines (CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline)?
ðŸ‘‰ AWS CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, CloudWatch, S3, and Lambda are used for CI/CD automation.

8. Explain CloudFormation and its benefits.
ðŸ‘‰ AWS CloudFormation is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service that provisions AWS resources using templates.
Benefits:

Automates provisioning

Ensures consistency

Enables version control

Easy rollback and scaling

9. Difference between EC2, S3, and RDS?
ðŸ‘‰

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Virtual servers for compute.

S3 (Simple Storage Service): Object storage for files and backups.

RDS (Relational Database Service): Managed SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.).

10. What is the difference between public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud?
ðŸ‘‰

Public Cloud: Services accessible to anyone (AWS, Azure, GCP).

Private Cloud: Dedicated cloud for one organization only.

Hybrid Cloud: Combination of public + private cloud for flexibility.

11. Explain IAM (Identity & Access Management) in AWS.
ðŸ‘‰ IAM manages access to AWS services securely. It creates users, groups, roles, and policies to define permissions.

12. What are Security Groups and NACLs?
ðŸ‘‰

Security Groups: Instance-level firewall (stateful). Controls inbound/outbound traffic.

NACLs (Network ACLs): Subnet-level firewall (stateless). Controls traffic at subnet level.

13. Explain Auto Scaling in AWS.
ðŸ‘‰ Auto Scaling automatically increases or decreases EC2 instances based on demand. It ensures high availability, cost efficiency, and performance optimization
14. What are AWS Regions and Availability Zones?

Answer:
An AWS Region is a geographical area that contains multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones (AZs). Each region is physically separated and designed to be completely isolated from the others for high availability and fault tolerance.
An Availability Zone is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity.

15. Explain VPC Peering and Transit Gateway.

Answer:

VPC Peering allows you to connect two VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds) so that they can communicate with each other using private IP addresses. It is ideal for connecting a few VPCs.

Transit Gateway is a network transit hub that allows you to connect thousands of VPCs and on-premises networks via a single gateway.

16. Explain Jenkins pipeline and how it integrates with AWS.

Answer:
A Jenkins pipeline is a suite of plugins that support implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins.
Jenkins integrates with AWS services using plugins (e.g., CodeDeploy, EC2 agents) to automate CI/CD pipelines, build code, run tests, and deploy applications on AWS.

17. What is Kubernetes and why use it in AWS (EKS)?

Answer:
Kubernetes is an open-source platform used for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
AWS provides EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), a managed service that makes it easy to run Kubernetes without installing or operating the control plane or nodes.

18. What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

Answer:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure using code and automation, rather than manual processes.
Popular IaC tools include Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, and Ansible.

19. Explain Elastic Beanstalk vs ECS vs EKS.

Answer:

Elastic Beanstalk: A Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for deploying and scaling web applications. AWS handles provisioning and infrastructure.

ECS (Elastic Container Service): A fully managed container orchestration service to run Docker containers.

EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service): A managed Kubernetes service to run Kubernetes workloads on AWS.

20. Explain AWS Lambda and its use cases.

Answer:
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.
Use cases:

```````````````````Real-time file processing (e.g., image uploads)

Data transformation

Backend services for APIs

Automation tasks (e.g., cron jobs)
